The run_analysis.R script was designed to generate tidy data from raw data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.
The project was conduxted by the five (5) steps required as described as follow.
Step 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Step 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Step 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Step 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Step 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
